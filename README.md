# ‚Äñ HeroHub ‚Äñ In dire need for supernatural powers? Book a day with your favorite SuperHero. ü¶∏üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

_HeroHub is a computer-first web app where users can book a superhero for a day. The project is a C2C platform working like an AirBnB website, where users can book a service, and owners(superheroes) can either choose to accept or decline the booking._

#### Visitors can:
- land on the homepage, to learn more about HeroHub services
- view a list of the superheroes who are offering their services, with each card giving a short description of the service
- choose a superhero and see more details about it

#### After signing up / logging in, users can book a superhero of his choice:
- They enter a date and write a comment as to explain the purpose of the booking
- The booking is then pending, waiting for the superhero to confirm or decline the booking
- The dashboard lets users see and manage their previous / pending / and coming bookings

#### After signing up / logging in, superheroes can access their "I am a Superhero" menu:
- They can create a page to offer their services, giving a picture and detailed information such as race, powers and price
- They can visualize their own service page
- They have their own dashboard to confirm bookings, showing previous and coming bookings, too
- Superheroes can also be users and therefore book the services of another superhero
